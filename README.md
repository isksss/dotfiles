# dotfiles

I use [rhysd/dotfiles](https://github.com/rhysd/dotfiles) to manage my dotfiles.

## How to use

Please execute the following command.

Depends on [aquaproj/aqua](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua).

If you don't have these, use curl, tar (Linux), or unzip (Windows) to download them automatically.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:isksss/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
bash init.sh
```
